# Scaffold-Lab: A Unified Framework for Evaluating Protein Backbone Generation Methods

***

Official implementation for [**_Scaffold-Lab: Critical Evaluation and Ranking of Protein Backbone Generation Methods in A Unified Framework_**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.10.579743v3). 



## Description

**_Scaffold-Lab_** is the first unified framework for evaluating different protein backbone generation methods.  

We present the benchmark for both unconditional generation and conditional generation in terms of *designability*, *diversity*, *novelty*, *efficiency* and *structural properties*. Currently evaluated methods are listed below:

## Updates

* **_July 19th, 2024_**: We now enable motif positions to be partially redesigned with ProteinMPNN. Check out [here](https://github.com/Immortals-33/Scaffold-Lab/blob/main/demo/motif_scaffolding/motif_info.csv) to see the way of specification.
* _**June 19th, 2024**_ : Scaffold-Lab now supports AlphaFold2 for evaluation! The implementation of AF2 is built upon [LocalColabFold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold). We refer interested users to [here](https://github.com/Immortals-33/Scaffold-Lab?tab=readme-ov-file#alphaFold2-single-chain-version) for more details. 

> [!NOTE]  
>
> This is a **beta** version which has not been tested thoroughly. Bug reports and pull requests are especially welcomed.

## Installation

To quickly set up an environment, just simply run:

```bash
conda create -f scaffold-lab.yml
source activate scaffold-lab
# You may also need to install some dependencies manually in certain cases
pip install hydra-core --upgrade
pip install hydra-joblib-launcher --upgrade
pip install ml-collections GPUtil hjson h5py
```

## Outline

Here is a guide about how you can go through this repository. We aim to provide an easy-to-use evaluation pipeline as well as maximize the utility of individual scripts. Let's go through the structure of this repository as a start:

* `scaffold_lab`: This is the main directory to run different evaluations described in our paper.

* `analysis`: Scripts for calculating several metrics, including *diversity*, *novelty* and *structural properties*.  
* `baselines`: In order to generate protein backbones directly inside this repository, you may find the code of different methods baselines for [unconditional generation](https://github.com/Immortals-33/Scaffold-Lab#unconditional-generation) and [conditional generation](https://github.com/Immortals-33/Scaffold-Lab#unconditional-generation) then clone their repository under this content. it is highly recommended to run inference for different baselines **inside their own virtual environment** for potential conflicts of environmental dependencies.
  * Inside the `experiment` folder we provide scripts for performing motif-scaffolding experiments by *Chroma* using its `SubstrctureConditioner`. Refer the script for detailed information if you want.
* `config`: We place different configuration settings of [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) here to organize for evaluations. **Hydra** is a hierarchical configuration framework to help users systematize different experimental settings. Though it might be confusing when you first get in touch with it, it is a powerful tool to help you perform experiments efficiently with different combinations of parameters, for example, _the number of sequences to generate_. We recommend readers to [Docs](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) for advanced usage.

## Usage
### Unconditional Generation

Let's start by running a simple evaluation here: 

```bash
python scaffold_lab/unconditional/refolding.py 
```

 This performs a simple refolding analysis for the proteins we put inside `demo/unconditional/`.

***

### Conditional Generation (Motif-scaffolding)

To run a minimal version on motif-scaffolding task, simply run:

```bash
python scaffold_lab/motif_scaffolding/motif_refolding.py
```

This performs a evaluation on `demo/motif_scaffolding/2KL8/` where the outputs would be saved under `outputs/2KL8/`.

***

### Customize Methods for Structure Prediction

We support both AlphaFold2 (single-sequence version) and ESMFold for structure prediction during refolding. 



#### ESMFold

Scaffold-Lab performs evaluation using **ESMFold** by default. Once you set up the environment this should work. 



#### AlphaFold2 (single-chain version)

The implementation of **AlphaFold2** is based on [LocalColabFold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold), which is a local version of [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold). We provide a brief guideline for enabling using AlphaFold2 during evaluation:

* **Install [LocalColabFold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold)**. Please follow the installation guide on its official page based on your specific OS. Note that it might take a few tries for a complete installation. 

* **Export executable ColabFold into your PATH.** This enables the running of ColabFold during the refolding pipeline. Suppose the root directory of your [LocalColabFold](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold) is `{LocalColabFold}`, then you can export variable PATH in two ways:

  * Set up inside the config **(Recommended)**.  Specifically, two ways to do so:

    * Inside `config/unconditional.yaml` and `config/motif_scaffolding.yaml` **(Recommended)**:

      ```yaml
      inference:
        af2:
          executive_colabfold_path: {LocalColabFold}/colabfold-conda/bin # Replace {LocalColabFold} by your actual path of LocalColabFold
      ```

    * Alternatively, set this in a command-line way:

      ```bash
      python scaffold_lab/unconditional/refolding.py inference.af2.executive_colabfold_path='{LocalColabFold}/colabfold-conda-bin'
      ```

  * Direct set variable PATH before running evaluation script, which is similarily done in #5 inside [this guide](https://github.com/YoshitakaMo/localcolabfold#for-linux). 
  
* **Set AlphaFold2 as your forward folding method when running evaluation**. Inside the config:

  ```yaml
  inference:
  ...
    predict_method: [AlphaFold2] # Only run AF2 for evaluation
    predict_method: [AlphaFold2, ESMFold] # Run both AF2 and ESMFold for evaluation
  ...
  ```

And voil√†!
