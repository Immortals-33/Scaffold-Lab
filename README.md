***

Official implementation for **_Scaffold-Lab: Critical Evaluation and Ranking of Protein Backbone Generation Methods in A Unified Framework_**. 

> Note: This repository is currently **under development**. The complete code and data regards to the manuscript will be released soon. However, please feel free to raise any question or discussion either via [issue]([Issues Â· Immortals-33/Scaffold-Lab (github.com)](https://github.com/Immortals-33/Scaffold-Lab/issues)) or [email](h2knight@sjtu.edu.cn)!

## Description

***

_Scaffold-Lab_ is the first unified framework for evaluating protein backbone generation.  

We present the benchmark for both unconditional generation and conditional generation in terms of *designability*, *diversity*, *novelty*, *efficiency* and *structural properties*. Currently evaluated methods are listed below:
